<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>

<p>I am writing in response to the posting on the career's website for the student aquatic biology position. Iâ€™m enrolled in the Biological science program at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, specializing in Environmental Toxicology.  
Based on the requirements, I believe that my skills and experience meet your requirements.</p>

<p> In my position as a Merchandiser at Extreme Toronto Sports Club, I was entrusted with the duties of balancing the inventory in stock daily, ordering more inventory for the company, as well as, stocking and mailing packages for customers.</p>

<p>Also, as an Overnight Shift Worker at Tim Hortons, I was entrusted with the duties of making coffee, taking orders and greeting customers in a fast paced environment. 
This allowed me to gain experience in time management and it also gave me experience handling money. </p>


<p>At my current position as an Overnight Freight Team Associate, I was entrusted with the duties of stocking inventory to full capacity and communicate with co-workers to ensure all products are stocked accurately. </p>
